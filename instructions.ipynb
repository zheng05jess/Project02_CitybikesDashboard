    "Congratulations on finishing the Observable lab! \n",
    "\n",
    "As a recap, in that lab we went through the motions of a creating very simple dashboard with Observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this assignment, you will be creating a dashboard of your own using the CityBikes API!**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<h3>API and Data Visualization Library Background</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CityBikes API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) is a great open-source project that provides free live bike-sharing data for apps, research, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API data is obtained using [pybikes](https://github.com/eskerda/pybikes), a set of tools that scrapes bike-sharing data from various websites and APIs to create a composite, coherent, and generalized dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "For your convenience, here are some useful and relevant endpoints from the API:\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get information on ALL the networks:** http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks\n",
    ">*This returns all the networks with every field. This is good to **reference** which fields are available but we generally will not need all these fields. See the next endpoint for how to filter!*\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get FILTERED information on ALL the networks:** http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks?fields=id,name,href\n",
    ">*This is an example of how to **filter specific fields** from the API! You can change the fields as needed (here, we are just looking for \"id\", \"name\", and \"href\").*\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get information on the Pittsburgh network:** https://api.citybik.es/v2/networks/pittsburgh\n",
    ">*This is the endpont we will be using for this entire assignment.*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*This is an example of how to get all information from a specific network with all fields.*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*Again, this is good for **reference** but we want to ideally filter out only the information we need. To do this with information from a specific network, the API does not provide a specific route but we can filter this within our application.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve into the creation of the dashboard for this assignment, let's also explore how we are creating these data visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using **Observable Plot** for this assignment. **Observable Plot** is a sister library to **D3.js** and was made to fulfill the need for the intersection between the expressiveness of **D3.js** and the ease-of-use of chart templates. It aims to enable the creation of expressive, customized data visualizations while limiting the amount of time spent on debugging and reading documentation that comes with lower-level languages like **D3.js**.\n",

    "<h2>Some Tips and Tricks!</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **START EARLY!!!** Starting too late will lead to added pressure and stress, particularly if debugging takes a long time (which it probably will). If you start early, you will have time to iterate on your work over time and take breaks. ***Iterated work is good work!***\n",
    "2. **Take breaks!** Sometimes the best solution is to take a breather from writing code and do something else. Staring at the same code for too long can make it harder to find where bugs are, coming back with fresh eyes will speed up the process significantly.\n",
    "3. Read documentation thoroughly and closely. **Make sure you understand fully what you are writing!!!** This will ensure you can identify where the bugs in your code could be.\n",
    "4. **Errors can cascade!** Try to trace the root of the issue rather than making surface level changes. The problem is more than likely earlier in the code and is affecting other portions, make sure you understand what the exact issue is!\n",
    "5. Check for any commas or semicolons missed! If a graph or other component isn't rendering, you most likely have a bug in your code for that particular component or it cascaded from a related component.\n",
    "6. Use `display()` to help debug errors and check what values an Object contains. This is particularly helpful when working with Maps, nest arrays, etc. It is similar to using a print statement or a `console.log()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Go to `package.json`\n",
    "> Under `\"scripts\"`, change the setting for `\"deploy\"` from `\"observable deploy\"` to `\"vercel --prod\"`.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The setting should now look like `\"deploy\": \"vercel --prod\",`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This will allow us to just run `npm run deploy` in the Terminal to deploy to production once we have deployment set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to `observablehq.config.js`\n",
    "> There is a commented-out setting called `cleanUrls` (it should be line 36 -> `//cleanUrls: true, // drop .html from URLs`)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Uncomment this setting by deleting the `\\\\` at the very front of the line (only the first `\\\\`).\n",
    "> Change `true` to `false`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The setting should now look like `cleanUrls: false, // drop .html from URLs`\n",
    "> \n",
    "> By default, Observable Framework generates “clean” URLs by dropping the `.html` extension from page links. The webhost we will use for deployment, Vercel, does not support \"clean\" URLs so we are setting that configuration to false.\n",
